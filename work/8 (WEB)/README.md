# Table generation.
    Table is generated by javascript. (Yes BOOM)
    When the page is loaded the HTML already contains Table. with first row. Then it contains also Input to use as filter options
    When javascript is loaded it makes a second row. it makes there an element with the number of row iterations. then it adds City name and population. it doesnt have to be like thios but its better
# Table filtering
    on adding text to input it check all name cells and leaves only ones with input data in them.
    reset just makes everyting appear again
