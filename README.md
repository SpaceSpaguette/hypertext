### Ordering methods.

1) each Project has its designated folder numbered and assigned its position.
2) in folders there are two things. First would be description of the projects *Used for backwards recovery.* and a picture of the final product.
3) Projects should contain basic metadata. **(Date, Name, Completed.)**
4) Folder homework is used for orders from tests and homeworks.
5) Code should be at least slightly explained and if any materials are used or just sketches. they all need to be uploded there.
6) Basic information in the code about what is executing isnt required but if present welcome.
